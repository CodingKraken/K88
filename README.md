# K88 8-bit Processor

The K88 (Kraken 88, inspired by the intel 8088) is intended to be a relatively realistic 8 bit computer processor, with 64 kilobytes of addressing space and
3 8 bit data registers. The processor includes 19 instructions which make for a fully turing complete processor architecture.

This project is still a work in progress so changes to the various files will be frequent.

For specifics on the instruction set, memory allocation and other details, see Outline.
The processor is preprogrammed with a fibonacci sequence calculator. An assembly version of this program can be found in fibonacci.ksm
